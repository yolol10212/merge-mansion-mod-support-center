First, make a copy of the file incase it breaks. this is very normal and very helpful. please do this, even if you think you know what you are doing.
right click on the merge mansion mod
press "edit"
look for "set /p m="
when you find it, look under it and see "if %M%=={random number or letter}"
change {random number or letter} to whatever you want
Now load the file back up and see if it worked or not.
